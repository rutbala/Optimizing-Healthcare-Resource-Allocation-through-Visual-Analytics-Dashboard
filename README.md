# Optimizing-Healthcare-Resource-Allocation-through-Visual-Analytics-Dashboard

The project “Optimizing Healthcare Resource Allocation through 
Visual Analytics” addresses the critical need for efficient resource 
allocation in healthcare. Aimed at hospital administrators and medical 
staff, this initiative leverages data-driven insights to enhance patient 
care quality, improve staff working conditions, and ensure economic 
sustainability of healthcare institutions

1 INSIGHT NEEDS

There are various insight needs and they are:

1.Optimal Staff Allocation: This involves visualizing staffing 
patterns against patient demand to determine the best staffing levels 
across various departments and shifts.
2.Resource Allocation Efficiency: Analysing the utilization of beds, 
rooms, and equipment to identify overuse or underuse.
3.Patient Flow Management: Identifying bottlenecks in patient 
transfers and waiting times, and developing strategies to improve 
patient flow.
4.Cost Control: Finding cost-saving opportunities without 
compromising the quality of patient care.


2 DAT A ACQUISITION

The various data that is contained in my dataset are:

1.Patient Admission Data: This includes records of patient’s 
admission, diagnoses, care requirements, and outcomes. 
2.Staff Scheduling Data: Comprises shift schedules and allocations 
for doctors, nurses, and support staff.
3.Resource Utilization Data: Details on the usage of beds, rooms, 
and equipment.
4.Patient Demographics: Information on age, gender, and medical 
history.


2.1 Descriptive Statistics of Data

Total Records: 100,000 patient admissions.
Staff Members: 1,000 (including doctors, nurses, support staff)
Resource: 500 beds, 100 rooms, 50 types of equipment.
Average Daily Admissions: 100 patients.
Patient Age Range: 0-100 years.


3 ANALYSIS METHODS

There are three types of analysis method that I have used to address 
my stakeholder’s insight needs.

1.Time Series Analysis: To examine patterns in patient admissions 
and staff scheduling. 
2.Resource Utilization Analysis: Identifying trends in hospital 
resource usage.
3.Network Analysis: Exploring patient flow and staff-resource 
interactions.
